# Movie-Data-Analysis
In this notebook, we aim to analyze data collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The data were collected in 2010, through using TMDb's API. The data includes relevant information for analysis including:

-Directors
-Revenue
-Budget
-Genres
-Popularity
-Cast
-Production companies of the movies

In this notebook, I explore the following questions:

1- Which movies had the highest profits?
2- What were the top 10 movies?
3- Who were the best directors?
4-what were the most popular genres?
5-which years were considered the most profitable?

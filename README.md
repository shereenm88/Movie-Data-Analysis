# Movie-Data-Analysis
1- The dataset I used is the TMDb movie data
2- In the notebook, I explored the following questions:
• Which movies had the highest profits?
• What were the top 10 movies?
• Who were the best directors?
• what were the most popular genres?
• which years were considered the most profitable?
3- To analyze those questions I used pandas, numpys and matplotlip for data visualization.
4- In the data wrangling step I cleaned the data using isnull, and .drop to remove null values and drop unnecessary data. I didn’t use fillna because I found it to be unnecessary given such data.
5- Statistics and plots can be found in details in the notebook.
